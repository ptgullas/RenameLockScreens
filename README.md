# RenameLockScreens
Save Windows 10 lockscreens that you haven't saved, rename them &amp; sort them into portrait &amp; landscape folders.

If you use Windows 10, you're probably familiar with those cool lockscreen images that refresh a few times a month. I like them, and wanted to keep them for myself. But I was tired of having to periodically check the Assets folder, copy them to a different folder, rename them, and then sort them into "Portrait" and "Landscape" folders. 

So, I wrote this console application as a personal project that automates a lot of the steps.
